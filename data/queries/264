U.S. Citizens in Foreign Jails Identify instances where U.S. citizens
have been or are being held in foreign jails since the year 1900.
With International travel becoming more commonplace, many travelers,
whether due to ignorance of the law or with criminal intent, are
ending up in foreign jails.  Of interest is the country involved, the
reason for the seizure and jailing, and the sentence, if convicted.
U.S. intervention, if any, would also be of interest.

Earth magnetic pole shifting This topic will explore reporting on the possible shifting of the earth's magnetic poles. Some current literature, scientific and popular, is reporting evidence of the shifting of the earth's magnetic poles.  The degree of shifting is in dispute as well as whether this shifting will continue and the possible consequences of such shifting.  Besides the obvious effect on navigational aids, a major shift could bring about a realignment of earth's axis and a rotation of the earth on its axis with dire consequences.

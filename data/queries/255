Environmental Protection Name countries that do not practice or ignore
environmental protective measures.  Nations that do not practice or
ignore environmental protective controls degrade the progress other
nations have made in this vital area.  There are international efforts
to protect the environment.  The actions of some countries are of some
concern, however, because they may be ignoring efforts to conserve and
protect the world's resources.  The objective of this topic is to
identify countries that do not have environmental controls.

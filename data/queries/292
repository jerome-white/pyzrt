Worldwide Welfare Identify social programs for poor people in
countries other than the U.S.  To be relevant a document would
identify a welfare program in a foreign country and explain how it
works to aid citizens who have little or no income.  It would include
those who can't work because of a disability and people who have the
extra burden of small children.  The document should indicate how
these people are supported or not supported.  A relevant document
should identify the source of the monies used to support such welfare
programs.

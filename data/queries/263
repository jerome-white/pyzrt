Algae as Food Supplement What is the value of algae as a food supplement? A recent product that has come on the market is Blue-Green Algae, grown in Klamath Lake in Oregon by the Cell Tech Company. It is being promoted as a powerful food supplement with many beneficial effects, and marketed through direct sales in a pyramid-style company.  That is, individual dealers both sell the product directly to other individuals and also recruit their customers to become dealers themselves, and receive a commission on all sales made by their recruits, and their recruits' recruits, etc.  What is the opinion of the scientific and health community about this product's value? Is algae used as a food supplement anywhere else in the world?

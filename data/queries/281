Genetic code of yeast To be relevant a document must identify some benefit that scientists hope to gain from deciphering the genetic code of yeast. This benefit should relate to human cells since yeast cells are so closely related to human cells.  Researchers have been using yeast to study the fundamentals of genetics and scientists have long recognized that yeast provided insights into ways human cells work.  Relevant documents should answer questions such as:  What genes found in yeast have the same relative functions as genes found in humans?  Identify the full genetic sequence or pattern of yeast.  Identify a gene that reacts the same way on a yeast cell and a human cell.

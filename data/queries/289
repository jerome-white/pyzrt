For-profit hospitals How will the emergence of chains of for-profit
hospitals affect the hospital industry and the provision of health
care?  Over the past several years some community hospitals have been
forced to close, and others have seen their bed occupancy rate drop to
low levels.  Entrepreneurs have bought up inefficiently operated
hospitals, and have formed them into large chains.  The Columbia
Healthcare Corporation has been very active in this area, and by
October 1993 it had created a chain of 190 hospitals.  Critics of
these chains argue that they could limit consumer choice and
eventually raise costs as the chains became more powerful.  They also
say that the concentration on the bottom line could have an adverse
effect on health care, particularly if doctors are offered an equity
stake in the operations.  Any item which discusses the formation and
management of hospital chains, or which discusses how the chains
affect other hospitals or the provision of health care would be
relevant.

New Kennedy Assassination Theories A relevant document will provide
new theories about the 1960's assassination of President Kennedy.
Documents must provide new theories about the assassination of
President Kennedy that are contrary to the findings of the Warren
Commission.  This does not mean the new theory must indicate more than
one assassin but merely dispute any part of the Warren commission
findings.

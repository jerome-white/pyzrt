Air Traffic Control Systems To be relevant, an item will concern a
commercial airline accident anywhere in the world and consider, if not
outright attribute, the casualty to a difficulty (either mechanical or
human) with an air traffic control system.  The U.S. National Air
Traffic Controllers Association frequently warns that air traffic
control systems around the world are inadequate and that personnel are
frequently overworked.  Is there evidence in investigation data that
the mechanical and human systems worldwide frequently contribute to
airliner casualties?

 Seasonal affective disorder syndrome (SADS) Is seasonal affective
 disorder syndrome (SADS), (also known as seasonal absence of daylight
 syndrome), a worldwide disorder?  Relevant documents would contain
 any information that is discovered on SADS in general.  Of particular
 interest would be articles of information on the person(s), type
 environment, location, social class, etc.  The overall desire is to
 know if this disorder affects more people that live in areas where
 more dark hours are prevalant over light hours or does it apply
 largely to people who are more used to daylight and sunny hours
 versus dark and dreary hours.

World submarine forces Determine the number of submarines, both
nuclear- powered and conventional, presently in the inventories of all
the countries in the world.  We are looking for a count of operable
submarines in any country that currently has a navy with submarines.
To be relevant a document should give a specific number of submarines,
but not necessarily its entire fleet of submarines (although, that is
our ultimate goal).  A report of a French submarine suffering a mishap
in the North sea would not be relevant.  However, a report of a new
submarine being built in Shanghai that contains other valuable
information, such as "this is the third reported unit constructed at
this base" would be relevant.  Any information that would be
considered useful as an intelligence tool in determining a country's
submarine order of battle would be relevant.

Volcanic and Seismic activity levels This topic seeks to determine if there has been a significant, noticeable increase in volcanic and seismic (earthquake) activity. The scientific community and the new age writers are converging on the phenomena of increased levels of volcanic eruption (and of greater magnitude) and higher levels of seismic (earthquake) activity. The study will examine reporting to seek to determine if these perceptions are valid.

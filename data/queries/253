Cryonic suspension services Status report of the cryonic suspension
industry-background and future prospects.  Cryonics suspension is the
practice of quick-freezing a human body immediately upon death and its
preservation in a nitrogen environment for possible resuscitation in
the event that a cure is found for the cause of death.  There was a
rush by some to have this done when it first became feasible, but only
by those wealthy enough to afford the freezing and long-term storage
fees.  This search seeks to determine where the industry is today; is
it viable?

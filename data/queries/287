Electronic Surveillance Individual privacy rights vs electronic surveillance Does electronic surveillance by an organization of its employees violate that individual's privacy rights. Need information where electronic surveillance is being used and to what degree by an organization.  Also require documents which reveal laws and regulation governing the rights of an organization to electronically survey its employees.  Reports which indicate the circumstances which caused the organization to start electronic surveillance are relevant.  Other relevant documents may reflect information on an employee suing over his right to privacy and the circumstances of the event.  Look for what are most of the verdicts in these cases.  Also a relevant report would be one where other approaches are being considered to offset this growing problem between an individual's right to privacy and the security of an organization.

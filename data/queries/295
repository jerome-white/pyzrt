Deaths from Scuba Diving What deaths have resulted from scuba diving?
I am looking for actual examples of people who have died while they
were scuba diving, or of deaths that have occurred later but were the
result of scuba diving.  Quantitative reports of the number of deaths
are relevant.  Deaths from natural causes such as heart or asthma
attacks are relevant if the attack occurred while the person was scuba
diving.

Deaths directly or indirectly caused by scuba diving

Cost of national defense Compare the amount of money spent by the U.S. for national defense with the amount of money spent by another country. To be relevant a document should show cost figures for national defense by a country and compare that figure with cost figures for the U.S.  It can be the cost for the total defense or a cost for a portion of the defense, such as the cost for just the ground forces, a fleet of ships, intelligence services, etc.  Dollar figures can be rounded off such as "four billion" or "4.5 billion".  The cost of one defense item would also be relevant, such as a nuclear submarine or an antitank weapon.

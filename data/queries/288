More than a third of U.S. women and nearly a quarter of U.S. men are trying to lose weight at any one time, according to a report by the NIH. Evidence presented at an NIH Conference showed that diets fail the majority of time.  Some therapists believe that overweight people need to learn to accept themselves, forget their obsession of losing weight and get on with their lives.

Evidence of human life Evidence of the existence of human life 10,000 years ago. To be relevant a document would show evidence that humans existed in the New World 10,000 and more years ago. The evidence could range from human hairs, tools, fossils, etc. to bones of animals indicating human presence. Relevant documents would have to specify the evidence and the age suspected, as well as the basis for any theory presented.  Information on the Clovis Culture would be relevant.  Archaeology digs would probably be related in some way to each relevant document.
